# This GitHub repository contains a SQL script for analyzing COVID-19 data from the Excel file database. Below is a summarized description of my repository:

# This SQL script focuses on extracting insights from COVID-19 data, specifically looking at the infection and recovery rates, new cases, and death rates for different countries/regions. The script performs the following tasks:

# 1. Calculates the chance of a person dying when infected and does so for each country/region.

# 2. Calculate the chance of a person recovering per 100 cases of infection for each country/region.

# 3. Identifies the top 5 countries/regions with the highest number of new cases during a specific week.

# 4. Determines which country/region has the highest death rate from infection.

# This script is a useful resource for analyzing COVID-19 data and can provide valuable insights into infection and recovery rates as well as identifying areas with the highest number of new cases and death rates.

# This excel data contains 35000+ entries worldwide ranging from dates 01/22/2020 to 07/27/2020
# The columns include country/region, confirmed cases, deaths, recovered, active cases, new cases, new deaths, new recovered

# Real-world implications 
# From the 3rd question we could see that the United States in any weeks of the 2020 year had the highest amount of new cases. We can see this reflects the data in https://ourworldindata.org/covid-cases 
# From the 4th question we could see Yemen ranked the highest in death rate if infected. This is also reflected in real life because most of Yemen's healthcare facilities at the time would not be in working conditions.
