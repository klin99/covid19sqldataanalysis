# covid19sqldataanalysis
# This excel data contains 35000+ entries worldwide ranging from dates 01/22/2020 to 07/27/2020
# The columns include country/region, confirmed cases, deaths, recovered, active cases, new cases, new deaths, new recovered

# The goal of using SQL to exploring and analyzing this data is to find out: 
# 1) Chances of death if contracted with the virus at any given country/region
# 2) Chances of survival per 100 cases
# 3) Top countries/regions with the highest infectivity/new cases at any given week
# 4) Country with the highest death rate, showing places with poor healthcare

# Real world implications 
# From the 3rd question we could see that United States at any weeks of the 2020 year had the highest amount of new cases. We can see this reflects the data in https://ourworldindata.org/covid-cases 
# From the 4th questions we could see Yemen ranked the highest with death rate if infected. This is also reflected in real life because most of Yemen's healthcare facilities at the time would not in working conditions.
